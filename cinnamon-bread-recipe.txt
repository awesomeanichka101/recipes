Ingredients:
- 4 cups flour
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1 TBS yeast
- 1 jumbo egg
- 3/4 cup warm milk
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 2 TBS canola
- 15 drop cinnamon oil

  Inside rub:
  - Brown sugar
  - Lots of cinnamon

 Directions:
Dissolve yeast in milk and water. Add sugar, egg, canola, cinnamon oil, 2 cups flour, and salt to the mixture and combine well. Add the rest of the flour and kneed for 5 minutes until dough is smooth. Cover and let rest for 1 hour, then roll out so it's width is the same as the length of your greased bread pan and the dough is 1 inch thick. Drizzle some more canola until the dough is slightly greased. Rub the brown sugar onto the dough, then the cinnamon. Roll up the dough so the roll is the length of the bread pan. BE SURE TO TUCK IN THE ENDS AND PINCH THE FOLDS WELL! Cover and let rest for 30 minutes. When there are 10 minutes to go, preheat the oven to speed bake at 375 F. Make an arch over the bread pan with aluminum foil and put it in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes or until the bread is slightly golden brown. Take out of bread pan, set bread on a cooling rack, cover with a towel and let it cool off. Enjoy!
